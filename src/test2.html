          Autumn
        </h2>
           <p>In many places in the temperate zone, autumn is a time for harvesting most crops. 
            Deciduous trees (trees that lose their leaves every year) lose their leaves, usually after turning yellow, red, or brown. 
            In many countries, autumn is the time a new school year starts.
